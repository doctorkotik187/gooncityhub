* Coding Gamification

** NEXT ACTION

- [x] fetch all data for a repo
- [x] fix prs count, it is always 0 now
- [ ] compute project health

** Project Health

What is winning?

Winning is determined by *Project Health*.

- Stars / Forks (user feedback)
- Pick "random", important, hidden Issues, PRs and look how long it takes the project to fix them
- releases (should be somewhat frequent)

** MMR

- both global leaderboard rank and 1v1 MMR
- matchmaking like in league or clashofclans

** Battle Time

- constant lop of everything / actions going on in both repos
- all chat for "friendly" banter
- voting from community, maybe the dude who opened the issue / pr
- top player -> mid player -> last player (rookie)

** Misc Ideas

- fixed team size: 1v1, 3v3, 5v5, 10v10; but not more than 10, the project should send only their best
- dev setup information (as tags maybe) for each member (optional)
- streaks / combos ?!
- repo can use "protection" (for holidays, to avoid battle / being attacked)
- battle period ~1 month

** Battle Outcome Evaluation

- MMR calculation (maybe archievements, rewards)
- leaderboard updates
- top contributors
- history / everything recorded forever
- post battle winner and loser have a "cooldown" period
